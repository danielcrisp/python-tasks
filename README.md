# Python Tasks

I've put together some simple tasks that you can test yourself with.
Each task has a test that you can use to verify your work.

Take a look in the `tasks` directory.

When you've completed the tasks and all tests are passing please create a Pull Request.

## Installing

You should use Python 3.7+.

Install dependencies:
