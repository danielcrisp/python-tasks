# Task 1 - Duplicates

Sometimes you have a list that contains duplicates items that need to be removed. It can also
be useful to find out which items were duplicated.

## Your task

In the `duplicates.py` file you will find two functions which accept a list and return the result.

Please update these two functions so that they return the correct result. See each function's
docstring to find out what it should be doing.

Only change the logic inside the function (look for the comment).

## Checking your work

You can very that they are working by running the supplied test.
Make sure you have already installed `pytest` with `pip`.

Then run this command:

    $ python -m pytest -v test_duplicates.py

If you see two passing tests then you've got it working!
